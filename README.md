Food Sales Predictions

The food sales prediction project consisted of using Python to build predictive models for Outlet Sales. Over the last 6 weeks this data was cleaned, organized, and analyzed to make sure of proper performance of the analytical process. Below you will find multiple different charts to help visualize the end products of different steps. 

The different models that were used to review this information were a Linear Regression Model, and a Simple Decision Tree Model. Between those two models the one that performed the best was the Linear Regression Model. The r2 score for training was 0.56 and for test it was 0.57. The RMSE training score was 1139, and the test score was 1092. 

The overall goal of this project is to help predict different ways to help with Outlet Sales. The recommendation is to focus on Item Type and ITEM MRP to help increase Outlet Sales. For instance, having more attention and focus on specific items like seafood, starchy food, and dairy can help improve on outlet sales.
